PROGRAM ::= STATEMENT*
STATEMENT ::= TEMPO | LOOP | VERSE | RHYTHM | INSTRUMENT|PLAY
// fade-in & fade-out?

VERSE ::= “SET ” VERSE_ID “TO ” NOTE+
VERSE_ID ::= STRING
NOTE ::= SINGLE_NOTE (NOTE_STATE)? OCTAVE (DURATION)?
SINGLE_NOTE ::= [A-G] | R
OCTAVE::= [1-9] | 10
DURATION ::= “w” | “h” | “q” | “i” | “s” | “t” | “x” | “o”
// duration table pg26; We can also use other syntax, but I personally think this one is decent.
NOTE_STATE ::= “#” | “##” | “b” | “bb” | “n”
// sharp | double-sharps | flat | double-flats | natural note

TEMPO ::= “SET TEMP TO ” TEMPO_CONSTANT
// There is a list of tempo constants in the guide book, but not quite sure whether we can randomly assign a constant for the tempo.
TEMPO_CONSTANT ::= CONSTANT_VALUE
CONSTANT_VALUE=[40-220]

PLAY::=”PLAY ” VERSE_ID

LOOP ::= “LOOP ” VERSE_ID “ ” LOOP_TIMES “ TIME”
LOOP_TIMES::=[0-9]+
//for loop_times, is it better to use integer?
RHYTHM ::= ???
// Cause we can identify instrument&notation to use in the beat, so not quite sure how to implement this part

INSTRUMENT ::= “USE ” INSTRUMENT_TYPE “ FOR ” VERSE_ID
INSTRUMENT_TYPE ::= ”piano”|”bass”|”guitar”|”trumpet”|”violin”|”flute”|”whistle”

// there are 120+ different instruments in JFugue, probably we should narrow it down.

//I chose some common instruments, feel free to add more, I think the total number of instruments we provide should probably be under 20 for convenience sake.
