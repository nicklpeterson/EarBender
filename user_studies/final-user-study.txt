FINAL USER STUDY

User1: Quinn Liu
Age: 22
Gender: female
Major in Psychology, has experience with R.

She was quite confused by musical terms in the beginning, asked many questions about the definition of note, tempo, and duration.
Since she has programming experience, she understood the set command and loop command easily.
Rhythm command is the most confusing one, she didn't know if it should appear in the loop or somewhere else.
Without explanation, she understood the restriction we added toward PLAY SIMUL.
Her solution is exactly the same as the sample solution, indicating our language is pretty understandable for people with programming experience.

User2: Alice Qi
Age: 22
Gender: female
Has musical background, zero experience with programming.

She wasn't confused by musical terms, but she didn't quite understand how to define variables and asked several questions.
The purpose of setting layers while you can directly play those vars isn't that apparent for people without programming experience, but she eventually understood it after I explained the concept of reusing variables.
Most of her solution is correct, however, she got PLAY SIMUL wrong.
After asking follow-up questions, she was able to correct her solution.
It showed that the restriction of PLAY SIMUL isn't that obvious and can be quite confusing without explanation.

------------------------------------------

Summary:
- Without examples, it's hard for users without musical background to generate the correct code without explanation.
- User without programming experience has to ask follow-up questions to actually understand the syntax.
- Rhythm is the most confusing command.
- The restriction of PLAY SIMUL can be easily missed.
