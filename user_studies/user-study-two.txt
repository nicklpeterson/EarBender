Taylor was able to understand the syntax after going through the examples. Rhythm was the most difficult for her to understand.
I think this is partially because she does not have experience with drum set pieces and partially because the syntax is a bit confusing.
She got the sample correct, but had to ask a few follow questions about the syntax.
